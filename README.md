The algorithms such as VGG16 and MobileVit for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) detection enables a revolutionary approach to understanding child expression. By analyzing intricate facial features and expressions, these algorithms offer a non-invasive means to identify potential indicators of ASD. This technological synergy fosters early detection, allowing for timely intervention and tailored support to enhance the expressive capabilities of children with autism, ultimately fostering a more inclusive and supportive environment.
